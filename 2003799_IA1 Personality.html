<h3> Personality Test Result Reflection </h3>
<h4> When I contrast and compare the results of this test and my day to day life as well as tendencies, I would say that this test is about accurate.</h4>
</br>
<h3> Show how your primary traits would impact your school/academic life.</h3> 
<h3> I would consider my primary trait to be kindness.</h3>
<h4> Kindness can greatly enhance the academic life of college students in several ways:</h4>
<h4>-Supportive Community: Encouraging words and mentorship help boost confidence and foster belonging.</h4>
<h4>-Collaboration: Initiating study groups and offering peer tutoring promote teamwork and knowledge sharing.</h4>
<h4>-Inclusivity: Welcoming new students and respecting diversity creates a more connected environment.</h4>
<h4>-Positive Environment: Small gestures like notes or snacks improve morale, while constructive feedback motivates peers.</h4>
<h4>-Mental Well-Being: Checking in on friends encourages open discussions about mental health and promotes balance.</h4>
<h4>-Lasting Connections: Kindness leads to strong professional relationships and friendships that provide ongoing support.</h4>
<h4>Overall, embodying kindness enriches both personal experiences and the academic community.</h4>

<h3>My favorite quote is from Marcus Garvey and it reads:</h3>
<h4>"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. None but ourselves can free our minds."</h4>
<h4> This is my favorite quote because it emphasizes the importance of self-liberation and empowerment.</h4> 
<h4>In addition it also reminds me to think for myself and not just 'go with the flow' believeing everything I am told.</h4>
